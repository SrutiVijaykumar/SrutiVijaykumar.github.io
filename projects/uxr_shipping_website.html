    <h2 class="text-2xl text-brand font-bold">Three Key Insights</h2>
    <p>
      <ol class="list-outside list-decimal mx-6">
        <li>The table for comparing mail services had low discoverability and even the participants who found it, were overwhelmed by the information.</li>
        <li>Sometimes participants looked for guidance regarding sending food, but did not think to look under “Perishable Items” in “Restricted & Prohibited Items” and instead thought there was no guidance.</li>
        <li>The feature of Holding Mail has a 30-day limit but to know that participants need to sign in or sign up which discouraged them from exploring that option.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

  <section class="my-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl text-brand font-bold">Three Key Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      <ol class="list-outside list-decimal mx-6">
        <li>Users may appreciate more interactivity, such as checkboxes to select the services or aspects users want to compare, rather than seeing the entire table.</li>
        <li>Add “Food” to the text for Perishable Items - for example, “Food & Other Perishable Items,” or “Perishable Items (and Food)” (depending on where you want it to appear in the alphabetical list).</li>
        <li>Consider the feasibility of changing Hold Mail so that users can find some information about the service without having to sign in.</li>
      </ol>
