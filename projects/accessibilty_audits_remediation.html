      I worked on about <span class="underline">two dozen accessibility projects</span> at UserWorks for government and private sector clients. These projects include website accessibility evaluations and document remediations.

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-brand font-bold">Impact</h2>
    <p>
      <ul class="list-inside list-disc mx-6">
        <li>Made 20+ websites, and 500+ pages of documents accessible to PWD. </li>
        <li>Mentored peers and encouraged a holistic understanding of accessibility. </li>
        <li>Trained product teams in best practices for a more sustained approach to accessibility.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl text-brand font-bold">Overview of Approach</h2>
  <section class="my-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Project Planning</h3>
    <p>
      In this phase, the focus is on becoming familiar with the contents of the web pages and documents and answering the following questions:
      <ul class="list-inside list-disc mx-6">
        <li>What is the scope of the project?</li>
        <li>What is the project timeline?</li>
        <li>Who is in the team and how are we distributing efforts?</li>
        <li>What do we need to get started? This could include login credentials, IP whitelisting, use cases, and dummy data for the use cases</li>
        <li>Do we need a subject matter expert to help us with the use cases?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Accessibility Evaluation </h3>

    <p>Step 1: Test the website using automated accessibility testing tools like Lighthouse/WAVE to flag problem areas.</p>
    <p>
      Step 2: Evaluate the website manually using keyboard-only navigation tests, color contrast checks, and assistive technologies like:
      <ul class="list-inside list-disc mx-6">
        <li>Screenreaders (JAWS and VoiceOver) </li>
        <li>Speech recognition software (Dragon Naturally Speaking)</li>
        <li>Screen magnification software (ZoomText)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Step 3: Test the web pages/documents with PWD and gather feedback.</p>
    <p>Step 4: For every issue identified, describe the experiences of PWD, cite the appropriate WCAG 2.1 standards, and include screenshots.</p>
    <p>Step 5: Provide multiple recommendations for each issue logged, so that developers can compare options and choose from multiple solutions.</p>
    <p>
      Step 5: Assign a severity rating to each issue so that developers can prioritize the remediation work.
      <ul class="list-inside list-disc mx-6">
        <li>​​High Severity: Likely to prevent PWD from completing a critical task.</li>
        <li>Medium Severity: Likely to prevent PWD from completing a non-critical task OR likely to cause confusion or frustration and have a significantly negative impact on, but not prevent, PWD from completing a critical task.</li>
        <li>Low Severity: Potential to cause minor confusion or frustration and negatively affect (e.g., slow down), but not prevent, PWD from completing a task.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <section class="my-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Report</h3>
    <p>Details of the project and a summary of all the positive findings and issues are combined in a PDF document as one of the deliverables.</p>

  <section class="my-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Findings Presentation and Collaboration</h3>
    <p>
      <ul class="list-inside list-disc mx-6">
          <li>Give stakeholders about a week or as much time as they need to go through the spreadsheet and the report before we present our findings. </li>
          <li>
            Ensure that the developers feel ready to start the remediation.
            <ul class="list-inside list-disc mx-6">
              <li>Present our findings</li>
              <li>Answer questions</li>
              <li>Discuss severity ratings and prioritize remediation of issues identified</li>
              <li>Discuss alternative solutions and their impact on PWD</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <li>List all the positive findings and encourage stakeholders to continue these practices</li>
        <li>List issues and their impact on PWD </li>
        <li>Share best practices in web accessibility with demonstrations</li>
        <li>Emphasize “no-excuses” practices that can be easily implemented</li>
        <li>Suggest methods to integrate more complex practices into the product development lifecycle </li>
