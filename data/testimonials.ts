    full_quote: 'Sruti is focused, passionate and enthusiastic person when it comes to work. When she joined our company as a fresher, she established herself as an invaluable team member, growing quickly and willing to take on new responsibilities in her projects coming up with fresh and innovative ideas. I have not only seen her excel in terms of UI/UX, but also in learning new techniques that were beyond the scope of her role, like Character design and isometric illustrations, which in turn benefited the entire team. Sruti would definitely make a great addition to any team. I certainly miss working with her and only have optimistic predictions for her future career.',
