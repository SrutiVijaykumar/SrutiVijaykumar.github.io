      Hi, I'm Sruti (pronounced Sroo-Tea), and my pronouns are she/her.Â <br/>

    <p class="font-sans leading-normal">
      As a User Experience Researcher, I have made products more efficient, inclusive, and, in some cases, life-saving! I developed an interest in accessibility while studying at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Initially intimidated by it, I quickly learned how straightforward and rewarding it could be and wanted to help others in tech  (and everyone else in my life ;-)) understand it better. I honed my craft while working at UserWorks, Inc., in Silver Spring, Maryland, as a UX & Accessibility Specialist for three years. I am looking for new opportunities at the moment. My vision is to see accessibility be seamlessly integrated into every product's development process.

    In my free time, I cook. A lot. It's my way of unwinding, experimenting, exploring cultures, showing love, and feeling closer to my family in India. Here are some pictures:

    I also enjoy home improvement projects, satirical news shows, and reading. I'm currently reading "Three Thousand Stitches" by Sudha Murty.
